# Xelmish

XNA + Elmish

TODO:

- config object:
  - specify clear colour
  - specify if mouse visible
  - fixed framerate, possibly
  - fps in console?
- how would renderView work?
  - remove from loop class, this time
  - needs a way to access mouse/keyboard state
    - a cache of pressed, released?
  - needs a general 'interaction checker', that ties in with dispatcher
