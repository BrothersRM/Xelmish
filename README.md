# Xelmish - XNA + Elmish!

**Xelmish** is a small project that creates an **X**NA Game loop (via Mono Game) and connects it to the **Elmish** MVU architecure, via a custom setState method in its own version of the classic Elmish.Program module (Xelmish.Program). 

In this way, you can develop games using the excellent Elmish architecture, with all the power of an XNA renderer! You can also convert existing Elmish applications to use Xelmish by rewriting their view functions.

## Simple Example of Usage

## Development Info

Xelmish was developed first with Visual Studio Community 2017, then later with Visual Studio Community 2019, on various Windows 10 machines. A Visual Studio solution file is in the root of the project if you wish to build using these IDEs. However, it should be fully compilable from the command line and other IDEs if that is your preference.

It has been built with pure dotnet core 2.2, and you will need to have this installed to compile it. Xelmish and its samples have been tested on Windows 10 only.
