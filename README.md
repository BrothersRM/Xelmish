# Xelmish - XNA + Elmish!

Xelmish is a small project that creates an XNA Game loop (via Mono Game) and connects it to the Elmish MVU architecure, via a custom setState method in its own version of the classic Elmish.Program module (Xelmish.Program). In this way, you can develop games using the excellent Elmish architecture, with all the power of an XNA renderer, or even simply convert existing Elmish applications to this architecture through view rewriting!
