# Tetris Clone

This is the third sample, and unlike the other two prior samples (simple-counter and sub-model), this project is written from scratch for Xelmish. It is more involved, and makes better use of the XNA engine behind the scenes.

Each 'screen' in the game is an Elmish component with its own model, messages and update. However the 'Playing' screen is the most complicated obviously, so this readme will focus on deconstructing that.

## 'Playing' component

## Todo:

- fix drop and tick overlap
