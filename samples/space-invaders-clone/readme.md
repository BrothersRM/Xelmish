# Space Invaders Clone

A partial recreation of the 1979 classic. In contrast to Tetris, there are many more things going on with the game at the same time, pushing Elmish-architecture a little further.

This sample also uses artwork, specifically a sprite sheet for the player and invader graphics. The invaders and projectiles are animated, so you can see a way that can be done with Xelmish.

Space Invader sprites by [GooperBlooper22](https://www.deviantart.com/gooperblooper22), acquired from [here](https://www.deviantart.com/gooperblooper22/art/Space-Invaders-Sprite-Sheet-135338373). These have been provided under no specific license, but credit given anyway.

The game itself, for mechanic reference, was played via the [Internet Archive](https://archive.org) where it is published [here](https://archive.org/details/Space_Invaders_1985_Sega_Taito). Space Invaders was a bit before my time (i.e. published years before I was born) so having a reference to recreate was very useful.
